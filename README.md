# TimeDate

Small TOS program to display and set time &amp; date on ATARI ST

Noting that the different IDE available on the ATARI ST are only working good, when your system time ist set properly
I searched the web for a some setting tool for this. To my surprise I was not succesfull, so I created one in an afternoons
work.
Can be copied in your AUTO-folder, so you will be asked at system start-up to set teh correct date and time.
Be pedantic with the syntax as I don't do any error checking, just repeating displaying time&date and giving the opportunity
to change it until acceptable.
